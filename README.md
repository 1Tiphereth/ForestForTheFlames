1. download BepInEx ***nightly*** (*il2cpp*) for your specific architecite (*BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.x.x*) (https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)
2. extract BepInEx to the game's directory and run it, which should then popup with a console window of BepInEx's logs and stuff (in the case of limbus `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Limbus Company`)
3. wait until it launches the game normally (~a few sec)
4. head to the `\BepInEx\plugins` directory and extract/place the desired mod(s)
5. re-launch the game normally causing the BepInEx console to appear, at which point you can look at logs/messages/info provided by the loaded plugins
6. hope and pray that a `"Plugin {my very cool plugin} is loaded!"` message apears, at which point just go regulary with how you launch the gane
